Looping is a way to repeat lines of code in programing. There are four different kinds of loops: while loop, do while loop, for loop, and for each loop. While loop are used usually when a set amount goes down until there isnâ€™t any more integers left. Do while loop are usually for conditions, and stop at the end of the loop and usually run only once. For loop functions the same as the while loop, but uses a different syntax. For each loop is useful for iterating through collections such as arrays. To modify an element, use a for loop.
