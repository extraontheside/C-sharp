Enumerations are similar to arrays, but each variables or integers are given a number value. This makes one of a set a value. Enumerations have possible set of values. Enums are put inside of a class or outside. Enums are put inside a class if only that class needs access to it. Enums are put outside if other classes need access. Uses a capital letter for the type and not a variable. Use brackets with the constants, separated by commas. Add a semicolon to close the statement. The default values of each constant starts with 0 and goes to one, two, etc. This can be override by using the equals sign followed by each constants.
