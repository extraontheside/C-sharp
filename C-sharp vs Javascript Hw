The difference between C# and Javascript are, C# scripts has the class declarations shown while Javascript declarations are hidden, which means that whatever is written is automatically inside the class. C# variables start with writing the type of variable, followed by naming the value, then a default value. In Javascript, the variable declaration starts with “var” followed by the name of the variable, then a colon, next a type, and last a value. A function declaration begins with a type of variable that either returns or not returns from the function. In Javascript, a function declaration begins with “function” followed by the name of the function and last any parameters. In C# the default access modifiers is private while Javascript default is public.


Coding syntax means the structure of the language. Some conventions are essential to read and write code. The dot operator is a stop for code that says stop. It separates elements of a compound item in Unity with many elements. The semicolon is used to terminate statements. They are used at the end of a line of code. Not all parts of codes are statements. Examples include the opening or closing of a class declaration or the opening and closing of a functions or if statements. Indenting organize code by having space within code with brackets. This makes it easier to read code and find things quickly. Comments are used similarly to notes. Use double slash or star-slash to write notes for other coders, disable codes, and / or a note for the user.
