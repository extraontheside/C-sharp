Switch statements are used for decisions in code. One can use a series of if and if else statements, but using a switch statement is more useful to compare a single variable to a series of constants. A switch statement starts with the syntax, switch, followed by a variable in parentheses. Next an open brace with definition of cases. To create a case, use the syntax, case, follow by a constant, then a colon. Next, add text. Lastly, use break and a colon to end the statement. You can add more cases. The last case should be named default. This will help code re loop itself if none of the cases meet the requirement.
