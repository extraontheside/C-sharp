Classes are the casing of variables and functions. It is important that the name of the class is the same as the file. 
Classes are an organizational tool called object oriented programming (OOP). The reason for OOP is to split the script 
into multiple scripts in which are able to take single roles. Classes should be designated to one task. When adding 
values to classes, add a data type, then a name, and then add a constructor. The constructor is a function than can be 
used to add values to variables. Constructors can have parameters to set variables. Adding integers help define variables.

Scopes are variables in code that variables can be used in. Variables should be local to the place in code that it can 
be used. Using braces create code blocks and code blocks defines variableâ€™s scope. There are public and private access 
modifiers. Access modifiers is a keyword placed before a data type before declaring variables. The purpose of this is to 
define where the functions and variables can be seen from. If other scripts need to access the variable or function, use 
public. Having it public makes the variable is shown and editable on the component in the inspector. The default access 
modifier is private. Private variables can only be editable in the class.
